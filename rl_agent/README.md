# Browser-Use RL Agent

This module implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to optimize browser interactions. The goal is to minimize the number of steps and resources required to complete user tasks while maintaining high task completion accuracy.

## Structure

- `state.py`: Defines the browser state representation for RL
- `action.py`: Implements the action space and action selection logic
- `reward.py`: Contains the reward function implementation
- `model.py`: Houses the RL model architecture
- `training.py`: Training loop and data collection utilities

## Components

### State Space
- Browser DOM state
- Visual state
- Navigation history
- Performance metrics (steps, tokens, time)

### Action Space
- Browser interactions (click, type, navigate)
- Action parameters
- Success probability estimation

### Reward Function
- Task completion alignment
- Resource efficiency (steps, tokens, time)
- Success/failure signals
- Navigation efficiency

## Training Process

1. Data Collection
   - Record human demonstrations
   - Store state-action-reward transitions
   - Track task completion metrics

2. Model Training
   - Initial training on demonstration data
   - Fine-tuning through exploration
   - A/B testing against LLM-only approach

3. Deployment
   - Gradual rollout
   - Performance monitoring
   - Continuous improvement

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
